There are many possibilities when it comes with starting a company. As such there are plenty of opportunities to fail and limited opportunities to succeed. It's also very difficult to associate a project with the right backers. The website Kickstarter allows users to support, give money to, a project that they have deemed worthy. Unfortunately, Kickstarter provides the user with so many projects that finding the hidden gem in the ocean that is called Kickstarter is almost impossible.


Using the [Kaggle dataset of Kickstarter projects]('https://www.kaggle.com/kemical/kickstarter-projects'), we aim to use supervised learning to determine if a certain project is deemed to succeed or fail miserably and forgotten in the abyss depending on specific project characteristics.

Moreover, we intend to add a recommendation system to help the casual users find a hidden gem in the ocean of project's possibilities.
